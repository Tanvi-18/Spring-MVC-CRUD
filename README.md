# Spring MVC CRUD Operations

## Overview

The Spring MVC CRUD Operations project is a web application that exemplifies fundamental CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. It adheres to the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern, providing a structured and maintainable codebase.

In this context:

- **Model (M):** Manages data and business logic, including entities, repositories, and services. Entities represent data objects, repositories interact with the database, and services encapsulate the application's business logic.

- **View (V):** Presents the user interface and displays data to users using technologies like JSP and HTML. It creates a user-friendly front-end experience.

- **Controller (C):** Handles user requests, interacts with the Model to retrieve or update data, and directs the View to render appropriate responses. It serves as the central hub for processing user actions.


## Key Components

### Dispatcher Servlet

- **Description:** The Dispatcher Servlet acts as the front controller in a Spring MVC application. It receives all incoming HTTP requests and directs them to the appropriate controller for processing. It plays a central role in request handling and acts as an entry point to the Spring MVC application.

### Handler Mapping

- **Description:** Handler Mapping is responsible for mapping incoming HTTP requests to the appropriate controller methods. It defines the URL patterns and the corresponding controllers, ensuring that requests are routed to the correct controller for further processing.

### Controller

- **Description:** Controllers in Spring MVC are responsible for handling user requests and performing specific actions. They receive input from the Dispatcher Servlet, process the data, interact with the Model to perform CRUD operations, and determine which View should be rendered to the user. Controllers are a crucial part of the application's business logic.

### View Resolver

- **Description:** View Resolver is responsible for determining which View should be used to render the response to the user. It takes the logical view name returned by the controller and maps it to an actual view template, such as a JSP file or HTML page. This component helps in separating the presentation logic from the controller logic in the application.

These components work together to implement the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern in a Spring MVC application, allowing for a structured and maintainable codebase.

## Features

- **User Interface:** Provides a user-friendly web interface for performing CRUD operations.
- **Data Storage:** Utilizes a relational database (e.g., MySQL) with easy configuration.
- **CRUD Operations:** Offers endpoints and forms for creating, reading, updating, and deleting data entries.
- **Data Validation:** Ensures data integrity through validation.
- **Project Structure:** Follows best practices for code organization.
- **Maven Build:** Simplifies dependency management and project building with Apache Maven.
- **Configurability:** Easily configure database connections and application properties.

## Prerequisites

To run this project, you'll need:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher.
- Apache Maven for dependency management.
- A Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse).
- A database system (e.g., MySQL) with a configured connection.
- A servlet container (e.g., Tomcat) for deploying the web application.
