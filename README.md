# Spring MVC CRUD Operations

## Overview

The Spring MVC CRUD Operations project is a web application that exemplifies fundamental CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. It adheres to the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern, providing a structured and maintainable codebase.

In this context:

- **Model (M):** Manages data and business logic, including entities, repositories, and services. Entities represent data objects, repositories interact with the database, and services encapsulate the application's business logic.

- **View (V):** Presents the user interface and displays data to users using technologies like JSP and HTML. It creates a user-friendly front-end experience.

- **Controller (C):** Handles user requests, interacts with the Model to retrieve or update data, and directs the View to render appropriate responses. It serves as the central hub for processing user actions.

## Features

- **User Interface:** Provides a user-friendly web interface for performing CRUD operations.
- **Data Storage:** Utilizes a relational database (e.g., MySQL) with easy configuration.
- **CRUD Operations:** Offers endpoints and forms for creating, reading, updating, and deleting data entries.
- **Data Validation:** Ensures data integrity through validation.
- **Project Structure:** Follows best practices for code organization.
- **Maven Build:** Simplifies dependency management and project building with Apache Maven.
- **Configurability:** Easily configure database connections and application properties.

## Prerequisites

To run this project, you'll need:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher.
- Apache Maven for dependency management.
- A Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse).
- A database system (e.g., MySQL) with a configured connection.
- A servlet container (e.g., Tomcat) for deploying the web application.
